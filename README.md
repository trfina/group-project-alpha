Many people find video games enjoyable because they can immerese themselves in worlds of their choice. One of the most popular genres of video games is the strategy genre. Strategy games require users to think critically and plan carefully in order to win. Within the strategy genre, one can find Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games such League of Lengends (LOL).

In LOL, players control characters called champions. Five champions make up a team. The object of the game is to destroy the opposing team's base. When LOL was first released in 2009, their were 40 chhampions a player could chose from. As of this writing in 2021, there are 157 champions.

Players can unlock champions using in-game currency, which they can acquire either by playing the game, or buying it outright. Unlocking all 157 champions would require hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of gameplay. To whet players' appetities, LOL offers about 10 percent of its champions roster as free-to-play each week, on a rotational basis. This rotation is the basis for our app.
